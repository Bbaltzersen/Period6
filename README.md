*Explain the concept of Hybrid Mobile App Development*

The problem with developing apps to phones are that there's quite a few different operating systems, and each of them have a coding language specified for that system, and if each app have to be developed for more than one phone it can quickly become time consuming.
That's where hybrid app development become handy, where it takes use of the phones webview and makes it possible for the phone to use apps developed in html/css and javascript, and by that saves a lot of time.

*Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid Mobile App Development

- Cost (By taking less time, it can save money in the end)
Cons
- The efficiency (The performance of the native apps are faster than the hybrid ones)
- The user experience can suffer because of the restrictions the emulations have.

*Explain about the "building blocks" involved in an ionic Hybrid Application*
